# pwd-canvas-sketch
This is a simple docker solution to experiment with canvas-sketch without installing node.js and canvas-sketch locally.

First, go to play with docker lab and start a new session:
- https://labs.play-with-docker.com/

Add a new instance and run the following command on the command prompt:
- git ...
- mkdir src
- docker-compose build
- docker-compose run --rm -p 8888:9966 node sh
